		  , MAX(Average battery lifetime first use - Average permit term recycling repurposing
	,Delay time of a year), 0 )
	~	t/Year
	~	Initial value set to zero, but that is incorrect. Question: how many batteries were \
		there consumed before 2015? What is being released until the point it \
		takes the value from this formula (after delay time)
		
		Average permit term is also used as the forecasting period for building up recycling \
		capacity. In other words: recycling facilities will look at the expected \
		release of waste at the moment their facilities are ready to operate.
		
		Delay time is deterimined by the lifetime of batteries and the permit term \
		for recycling facilities. However, if the permit term is longer than the \
		average lifetime, one might get the situation that you want to look to \
		future consumption in order to estimate the released amount of batteries. \
		This would only be the case in extreme situations and the model is not \
		able to handle it. To prevent errors, the model assumes a minimum delay of \
		1 year in the forecasting or relaeased batteries for recycling and \
		repurposing.

		requirements for electrolyte (10%) cause 0.16 to be a realistic estimation.
		
		Note: since the numbers for each cathode type are very close to each other, it was \

		uncertainty reduction factor. 
		
		The only cathode that would demand more lithium is ASSB, since it contains \
		a lithium anode. In the scenario where ASSB is included, this might lead \

		are therefore assumed to be equal to these revenues (profits will be made \
